Hello! I am Sehajdeep Singh, a student at Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology, pursuing computer engineering.
I am a passionate coder, currently learning JavaScript. I like aesthetic and simplistic designs, which i try to incorporate into whatever i code.
I love listening to music 🎧, playing basketball🏀 and working out🏋 whenever im not coding/studying.

I would love to join a community that works on projects and develops and enhances everybody's skills!
